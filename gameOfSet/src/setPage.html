               The objective of this game is create a set of 3 cards from the 12 on the board.
               <strong>
               Each card has 4 properties:
                  
                  Color - Red, Green, or Purple
                  Number of Shapes - 1, 2, or 3
                  Shape - Oval, Squiggle, or Diamond
                  Shading - Solid, Partial, Outlined
                  </strong>
                  <i>Ex: green | one | oval | empty 
                  This would be a card with the properties of green for color, one for number of shapes, oval for shape, and empty for shading.</i>
               
               ~ A Set consists of 3 cards in which each of the card's properties is the same on each card or different on each card. ~
               
               <b>The Play</b>
               The deck of 81 cards is shuffled and then 12 are displayed.
               The player makes a guess by clicking on three unique cards displayed on the current board.
               If correct and no hint is used, the Set is removed and 3 points are awarded to the player that found the set.
               If the player presses the hint button, the player may only receive 1 point for the next set found.
               Then, 3 new cards from the deck replace the cards just removed.
               If incorrect, the cards remain on the board.
               If the player cannot find a set, the player should select "No Set."
               If there is indeed no set to be found on the current board, 3 new cards are added to the board creating a total of 15 cards.
               Once a set is found from 15 cards, no new cards are dealt and the game continues with the remaining 12 cards on the board.
               The game ends when the deck has been depleted and no sets remain on the board!
