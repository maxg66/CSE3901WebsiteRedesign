      The objective of this game is create a set of 3 cards from the 12 on the board.
      <strong>
      Each card has 4 properties:
         
         Color - Red, Green, or Purple
         Number of Shapes - 1, 2, or 3
         Shape - Oval, Squiggle, or Diamond
         Shading - Solid, Partial, Outlined
         </strong>
         <i>Ex: green | one | oval | empty 
         This would be a card with the properties of green for color, one for number of shapes, oval for shape, and empty for shading.</i>
      
      ~ A Set consists of 3 cards in which each of the card's properties is the same on each card or different on each card. ~
      
      <b>The Play</b>
      The deck of 81 cards is shuffled and then 12 are displayed.
      There are no turns - any player can then call out a set when they find one.
      If correct, the Set is removed and 1 point is awarded to the player that found the set.
      The player that found the sent would then enter their Player Number when prompted.
      Then, 3 new cards from the deck replace the cards just removed.
      If incorrect, the cards remain on the board.
      If all players agree that a set cannot be found, 3 new cards are added to the board creating a board of 15 cards total.
      Once a set is found from 15 cards, no new cards are dealt and the game countines with the remaining 12 cards on the board.
      The game ends when the deck has been depleted. The player with the most points at this time wins!
